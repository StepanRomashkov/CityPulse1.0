# CityPulse1.0

Final project at the Grand Circus made by Ameerah Gillespie, Justin Judd, Kristen Golembiewski and me. A web app that allows users to look for bars around the world and get the info before they even click on the marker. Logged in with Facebook account, user can look at the rating of the specific bar and rate that bar. The vote results are put into the database and displayed immediately. The working version of the app available at the address below.
